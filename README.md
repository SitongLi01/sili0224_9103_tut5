## **'Broadway Boogie Woogie' - *Piet Mondrian***

- These two artworks greatly inspired my next project, which refers to the lively street life of Broadway and woogie music, is characterized by syncopated rhythms and energetic melodies that echo the rhythmic arrangements of colour and line. Combining the smooth dynamics and rhythm of the previous two with this work can create rich layers and visual effects and also reflect the vitality of the painting.

# **Coding Technique Exploration**

- Use mouse or keyboard input to animate, and click to make the painting start to move or change colour, allowing for infinite variation and randomness, thus being able to create dynamic and ever-changing visuals reminiscent of Mondrian's rhythmic works, and start interactive style digital art.
